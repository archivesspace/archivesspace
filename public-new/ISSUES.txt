X Revise Search Functionality

* Returning to / using back button doesn't clear search results view

* How to make the back button restore the search query form state..

* When user toggles the "Revise Search" tools, and changes the state of the dropdowns, what should happen if she changes a settings that don't affect the query, such as pageSize?
  - discard the "Revise Search" state?
  - try to apply the revisions and the page size change?
  - not possible because "Revise Search" disables other controls?

* Solr fields of type 'string' will only match if the entire string
  matches. Therefore, they won't show up in highlights. For example,
  finding_aid_title. What would happen if this were changed to type
  'text_general'?
  * Similar - 'fullrecord' is indexed but not stored, therefore doesn't
  appear in highlight snippets. Maybe solve this by cleaning out the structural stuff and storing the field. Or maybe add a second lightweight version that gets stored.

* API appears to ignore search rows after 3.

X Revise Search toggle gets funked if the search url is the same

* Sort dropdown not working
