ArchivesSpace can manage its own user directory, but can also be
configured to authenticate against one or more LDAP directories by
specifying them in the application's configuration file.  When a user
attempts to log in, each authentication source is tried until one
matches.

Here is a minimal example of an LDAP configuration:

     AppConfig[:authentication_sources] = [{
                                             :model => 'LDAPAuth',
                                             :hostname => 'ldap.example.com',
                                             :port => 389,
                                             :base_dn => 'ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',
                                             :username_attribute => 'uid',
                                             :attribute_map => {:cn => :name},
     }]

With this configuration, ArchivesSpace performs authentication by
connecting to `ldap://ldap.example.com:389/`, binding anonymously,
searching the `ou=people,dc=example,dc=com` tree for `uid = <username>`. 

If the user is found, ArchivesSpace authenticates them by
binding using the password specified.  Finally, the `:attribute_map`
entry specifies how LDAP attributes should be mapped to ArchivesSpace
user attributes (mapping LDAP's `cn` to ArchivesSpace's `name` in the
above example).

Many LDAP directories don't support anonymous binding.  To integrate
with such a directory, you will need to specify the username and
password of a user with permission to connect to the directory and
search for other users.  Modifying the previous example for this case
looks like this:


     AppConfig[:authentication_sources] = [{
                                             :model => 'LDAPAuth',
                                             :hostname => 'ldap.example.com',
                                             :port => 389,
                                             :base_dn => 'ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',
                                             :username_attribute => 'uid',
                                             :attribute_map => {:cn => :name},
                                             :bind_dn => 'uid=archivesspace_auth,ou=system,dc=example,dc=com',
                                             :bind_password => 'secretsquirrel',
     }]


Finally, some LDAP directories enforce the use of SSL encryption.  To
configure ArchivesSpace to connect via LDAPS, change the port as
appropriate and specify the `encryption` option:

     AppConfig[:authentication_sources] = [{
                                             :model => 'LDAPAuth',
                                             :hostname => 'ldap.example.com',
                                             :port => 636,
                                             :base_dn => 'ou=people,dc=example,dc=com',
                                             :username_attribute => 'uid',
                                             :attribute_map => {:cn => :name},
                                             :bind_dn => 'uid=archivesspace_auth,ou=system,dc=example,dc=com',
                                             :bind_password => 'secretsquirrel',
                                             :encryption => :simple_tls,
     }]
