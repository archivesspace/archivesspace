-------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming you've unzipped a fresh new release there are a couple of steps to take:

*Setup a Solr core*

On the Solr server make a core available for ArchivesSpace. Copy the solr files from the ArchivesSpace source into the core's conf directory and enable it:

https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/tree/master/solr

*Disable the embedded server Solr instance*

Edit the ArchivesSpace config.rb file:

```
AppConfig[:enable_solr] = false
```

Note that doing this means that you will have to backup Solr manually.

*Set the Solr url*

This config setting should point to your Solr instance:

```
AppConfig[:solr_url] = "http://solr.somewhere.org:8983"
```

Include path if required:

```
AppConfig[:solr_url] = "http://solr.somewhere.org:8983/solr/archivesspace"
```

---

You should monitor the ArchivesSpace logs and Solr to ensure that the indexer application is connecting to the external Solr instance.
