The primary configuration for ArchivesSpace is done in the config/config.rb
file. By default, this file contains the default settings, which are indicated
by commented out lines ( indicated by the "#" in the file ). You can adjust these 
settings by adding new lines that change the default and restarting 
ArchivesSpace. Be sure that your new settings are not commented out 
( i.e. do NOT start with a "#" ), otherwise the settings will not take effect.
