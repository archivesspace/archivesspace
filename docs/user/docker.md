The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) configuration is used to create [automated builds](https://hub.docker.com/r/archivesspace/archivesspace/) on Docker Hub, which are deployed to [the latest version](http://test.archivesspace.org) when the build completes.

## Custom builds

Run ArchivesSpace with MySQL, external Solr and a Web Proxy. Switch to the
branch you want to build:

```
bash
#if you already have running containers and want to clear them out
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm

#build the local image
docker-compose build # needed whenever the branch is changed and ready to test
docker-compose up

#running specific containers
docker-compose up -d db solr # in background
docker-compose up app web # in foreground
>to access running container
docker exec -it archivesspace_app_1 bash
```

## Sharing an image

To share the build image the easiest way is to create an account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Next retag the image and push to the hub account:

```bash
DOCKER_ID_USER=example
TAG=awesome-updates
docker tag archivesspace_app:latest $DOCKER_ID_USER/archivesspace:$TAG
docker push $DOCKER_ID_USER/archivesspace:$TAG
```

To download the image: `docker pull example/archivesspace:awesome-updates`.
