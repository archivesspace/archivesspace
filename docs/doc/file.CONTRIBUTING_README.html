<p>ArchivesSpace requires that all project contributors complete a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). The CLA clearly defines the terms under which intellectual property is
being contributed, and allows ArchivesSpace to provide comprehensive governance
over the project.</p>

<p>The Contributor License Agreement enables ArchivesSpace to update the licensing of its
projects, when necessary or desirable, while maintaining the provenance of the code,
and the rights of the contributors and adopters of this code.</p>

<p>The CLA also makes it possible for ArchivesSpace to defend the project, and/or its
contributors and adopters, should the project become the subject of any claim or
dispute, legal or otherwise.</p>

<p>In all cases, contributors retain full rights to use their original contributions for any other
purpose, while providing ArchivesSpace and its projects the right to distribute and
extend their contributed work.</p>

<p>Individuals must have an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) on file with
ArchivesSpace before any significant contributions will be accepted and before
“commit” privileges will be granted on ArchivesSpace projects.</p>

<p>Organizations that have tasked employees to work on an ArchivesSpace project must
also complete a Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) so intellectual
property that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement can still be
properly contributed. Individuals still also need to submit an ICLA, even when their
organizations has completed a CCLA. Individuals are responsible for making sure their
organization has completed a CCLA if their contributions are owned by their employer.</p>

<p>When an individual or corporation donates existing software or documentation to
an ArchivesSpace project, they need to execute a Software Grant License Agreement
(SGLA) with ArchivesSpace. This typically occurs as part of the Incubation process for
taking on new projects. Corporations can also provide a concurrent grant as part of the
CCLA itself.</p>

<p>Projects with pre-existing codebases need to complete Contributor Agreements with all
IP holders prior to formal acceptance by ArchivesSpace.</p>

<p>Contributor License Agreements may be submitted to ArchivesSpace in the following ways:</p>
