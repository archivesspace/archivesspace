// Since resources and archival objects use the front-end LargeTree for display, the active record
// on display can change independently of what the backend was last aware. This means we need to
// maniuplate the target attribute for the Create button so that the data from the correct record
// is used for spawning, not whatever @resource/@archival_object was initally passed into the view.
