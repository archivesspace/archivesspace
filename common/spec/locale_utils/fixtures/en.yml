      This is a multiline message with a variable %{variable_name}.
      It spans multiple lines with %{line_count} total lines and should be handled correctly.
      The variable should be detected and replaced if translated.
    multiline_folded: >
      This folded multiline text contains %{count} items
      and %{status} information that needs to be processed.
