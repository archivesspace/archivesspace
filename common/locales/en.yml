      "Physical Condition_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 intended to describe the overall condition of the materials in a collection; items or groups of materials of particular concern will be indicated in the conservation note.</p>
      "Physical Access (arrangement)": Physical Access (arrangement)
      "Physical Access (arrangement)_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 that applies to a collection’s physical arrangement, taking into account the complexity and size of collection. For example, a small, relatively homogenous collection in rough order is generally more physically accessible than a large, heterogeneous collection in rough order, and the ratings will reflect that fact. (Note that arrangement to the item level may not be desirable for many collections; a rating of 4 may be the top rating that is desirable for a collection.)</p>
