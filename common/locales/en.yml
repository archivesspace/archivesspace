    rating:
      "Reformatting Readiness": Reformatting Readiness
      "Reformatting Readiness_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 that indicates how easily materials can be reformatted.</p>
      "Housing Quality": Housing Quality
      "Housing Quality_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 intended to describe the overall quality of housing of the materials in a collection; items or groups of materials within a collection may be in better or poorer housing than what the overall rating indicates.</p>
      "Physical Condition": Physical Condition
      "Physical Condition_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 intended to describe the overall condition of the materials in a collection; items or groups of materials of particular concern will be indicated in the conservation note.</p>
      "Physical Access (arrangement)": Physical Access (arrangement)
      "Physical Access (arrangement)_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 that applies to a collection’s physical arrangement, taking into account the complexity and size of collection. For example, a small, relatively homogenous collection in rough order is generally more physically accessible than a large, heterogeneous collection in rough order, and the ratings will reflect that fact. (Note that arrangement to the item level may not be desirable for many collections; a rating of 4 may be the top rating that is desirable for a collection.)</p>
      "Intellectual Access (description)": Intellectual Access (description)
      "Intellectual Access (description)_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 that applies to a collection's intellectual description and the accessibility of that description to users.</p>
      "Interest": Interest
      "Interest_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 that indicates researcher, donor, or local interest in the materials. Interest + Documentation Quality create the "Research Value" score.</p>
      "Documentation Quality": Documentation Quality
      "Documentation Quality_tooltip": <p>A rating from 1 to 5 that applies to the richness and depth of documentation available in a collection. Interest + Documentation Quality create the "Research Value" score.</p>

Significant number of boxes and folders might have unreasonable amount of material in them or are not the correct size and type for the materials they house. For bound volumes, binding is in fair condition (boards might be detached).</li><li><b>Rating 3</b>: Collection housed in non‐archival boxes and folders but they are in good condition. Most boxes and folders have reasonable amount of material in them. Most boxes and folders are correct size and type for the materials they house. For bound volumes, binding is in good condition (somewhat the worse for wear yet intact).</li><li><b>Rating 4</b>: Collection housed partially in acid‐free boxes and folders in good condition. Most boxes and folders have reasonable amount of material in them. Most boxes and folders are correct size and type for the materials they house. For bound volumes, binding is in very good condition (expected wear).</li><li><b>Rating 5</b>: Collection housed completely in acid‐free boxes and folders in good condition.

Collection has no finding aid or a substandard finding aid. The collection has a MARC record in the OPAC or national bibliographic utility, but that does not provide sufficient access because it is a large or complex collection.

There is a collection‐level MARC record for the collection in the institutionʹs OPAC and/or in a national bibliographic utility such as OCLC.

There is a collection‐level MARC record for the collection in the institutionʹs OPAC and/or in a national bibliographic utility such as OCLC. There is a good finding aid, online or offline, but there is no collection‐level MARC record for the collection in the institutionʹs OPAC and/or in a national bibliographic utility such as OCLC.
