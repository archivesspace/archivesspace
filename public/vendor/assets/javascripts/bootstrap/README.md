# About this bootstrap directory

This directory was added via [ANW-2110](https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/browse/ANW-2110) which needed to remove the bootstrap gem dependency.

It works in conjunction with public/vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/.

The ./bootstrap.min.js file was sourced from the [source code zip file](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/archive/refs/tags/v4.3.1.zip) from the [v4.3.1 release](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/tag/v4.3.1), which was the bootstrap gem's version at the time. The file's path in the unzipped content is `dist/js/bootstrap.min.js`.
