         There are two implementations of cache available for Solr,
         LRUCache, based on a synchronized LinkedHashMap, and
         FastLRUCache, based on a ConcurrentHashMap.  

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache
         when the hit ratio of the cache is high (> 75%), and may be
         faster under other scenarios on multi-cpu systems.

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),
         unordered sets of *all* documents that match a query.  When a
         new searcher is opened, its caches may be prepopulated or
         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

         Parameters:
           class - the SolrCache implementation LRUCache or
               (LRUCache or FastLRUCache)

        matching the query. If found, the filter will be used as the
        source of document ids, and then the sort will be applied to
        that.

        For most situations, this will not be useful unless you
        frequently get the same search repeatedly with different sort

        An optimization for use with the queryResultCache.  When a search

        requests matching documents 10 through 19, and queryWindowSize is 50,
        then documents 0 through 49 will be collected and cached.  Any further

  <!-- Request Dispatcher

       This section contains instructions for how the SolrDispatchFilter
       should behave when processing requests for this SolrCore.

       handleSelect is a legacy option that affects the behavior of requests
       such as /select?qt=XXX

       handleSelect="true" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to process
       the request and dispatch the query to a handler specified by the
       "qt" param, assuming "/select" isn't already registered.

       handleSelect="false" will cause the SolrDispatchFilter to
       ignore "/select" requests, resulting in a 404 unless a handler
       is explicitly registered with the name "/select"

       handleSelect="true" is not recommended for new users, but is the default
       for backwards compatibility

    <!-- Request Parsing

         This will cause Solr to generate Last-Modified and ETag
         headers based on the properties of the Index.

         The following options can also be specified to affect the
         values of these headers...

         lastModFrom - the default value is "openTime" which means the
         Last-Modified value (and validation against If-Modified-Since
         requests) will all be relative to when the current Searcher
         was opened.  You can change it to lastModFrom="dirLastMod" if
         you want the value to exactly correspond to when the physical
         index was last modified.

         etagSeed="..." is an option you can change to force the ETag
         header (and validation against If-None-Match requests) to be
         different even if the index has not changed (ie: when making
         significant changes to your config file)

         the never304="true" option)

  <!-- Request Handlers 

       http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRequestHandler

       Incoming queries will be dispatched to a specific handler by name
       based on the path specified in the request.

       Legacy behavior: If the request path uses "/select" but no Request
       Handler has that name, and if handleSelect="true" has been specified in
       the requestDispatcher, then the Request Handler is dispatched based on
       the qt parameter.  Handlers without a leading '/' are accessed this way
       like so: http://host/app/[core/]select?qt=name  If no qt is
       given, then the requestHandler that declares default="true" will be
       used or the one named "standard".
       
       If a Request Handler is declared with startup="lazy", then it will
       not be initialized until the first request that uses it.
