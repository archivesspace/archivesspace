ArchivesSpace Stylesheets
=========================

ArchivesSpace includes three stylesheets for you to transform exported
into human-friendly formats. The stylesheets included are as follows:

* `as-eac-cpf-html.xsl`: Generates HTML from EAC-CPF records
* `as-ead-html.xsl`: Generates HTML from EAD records
* `as-ead-pdf.xsl`: Generates XSL:FO output from EAD for transformation into PDF

These stylesheets have been tested and are known to work with
[Saxon](http://saxonica.com/download/download_page.xml) 9.5.1.1 and higher.

The `as-helper-functions.xsl` stylesheet is required by the other three
stylesheets listed above.
