            <abstract id="beffff2" label="Abstract">The American and Foreign Christian Union (AFCU) was founded in 1849 as an interdenominational organization with the purpose of converting Roman Catholics to evangelical Protestantism. Headquartered in New York City, the AFCU was founded by the union of the American Protestant Society(1844-1849), the Christian Alliance (1842-1849), and the Foreign Evangelical Society (1839-1849). The AFCU employed domestic missionaries; supported individual missionary efforts and kindred societies in Europe, Canada, and South America; published a monthly journal, The Christian World (1850-1884). In 1884 the AFCU discontinued its active missionary work but continued to support the American Church in Paris.</abstract>

            <p>In January of 1885, the Executive Committee of the American and Foreign Christian Union offered its library of 743 volumes to New York University, with the stipulation that the University also provide storage for some books, pamphlets, and boxes of records which the Union wished to retain. It was agreed that if the Union did not call for the Library within ten years, the materials would then become the property of the University. The books and records were never reclaimed. The records were presumably transferred to the University Archives, although there is no written record of the transaction.</p>

                    <p>This series of letters and missionary reports has been arranged alphabetically by author. Attention should be given to the following points. The dates of the folders are inclusive and do not indicate gaps in the papers. The relationship of individuals employed or otherwise affiliated with the AFCU is indicated in parenthesis after their names. The contents of Miscellaneous folders should not be overlooked; they frequently contain correspondence from members. of the Board of Directors and officiating members of other organizations. If a correspondent has written in behalf of another organization, the papers are found under that corporate name. If the correspondent, who may perhaps be an agent of another agency, handwritten on his own behalf, the papers will be found under his name. In some cases both personal and corporate names should be consulted; for example, both Edward W. Hitchcock and Charles S. Robinson served as minister of the American Chapel in Paris and their letters should be considered with those in the American Chapel in Paris folder.</p>
